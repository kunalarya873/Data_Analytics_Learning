It is an open source project and you can use it freely.\n","\n","NumPy stands for Numerical Python.\n","\n","It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more."],"metadata":{"id":"aSL7ZhyuR9GU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance. There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences:\n","\n","NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original.\n","\n","The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n","\n","NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\n","\n","A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they often output NumPy arrays. In other words, in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient - one also needs to know how to use NumPy arrays."],"metadata":{"id":"vL2-d-tpUFm6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Why Use NumPy?**\n","\n","- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.\n","\n","- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.\n","\n","- The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\n","\n","- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important."],"metadata":{"id":"jIJ1HEAEUXvo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Python Objects**\n","\n","1. high-level number objects: integers,floating point\n","2. containers: lists(costless insertion and append), dictionaries(fast lookup)"],"metadata":{"id":"gGRRKzyrTgdS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?**\n","\n","NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.\n","\n","This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.\n","\n","This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists.
